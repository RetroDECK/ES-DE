# EmulationStation Desktop Edition (ES-DE) v1.2 (development version) - Themes

**Note:** This document is only relevant for the current ES-DE development version, if you would like to see the documentation for the latest stable release, refer to [THEMES.md](THEMES.md) instead.

If creating theme sets specifically for ES-DE, please add `-DE` to the theme name, as in `rbsimple-DE`. Because the ES-DE theme support has already deviated somehow from the RetroPie EmulationStation fork and will continue to deviate further in the future, the theme set will likely not be backwards compatible. It would be confusing and annoying for a user that downloads and attempts to use an ES-DE theme set in another EmulationStation fork only to get crashes, error messages or corrupted graphics. At least the -DE extension is a visual indicator that it's an ES-DE specific theme set.

## Introduction

ES-DE allows the grouping of themes for multiple game systems into a **theme set**. Each theme is a collection of **views** that define some **elements**, each with their own **properties**.

Every game system has its own subdirectory within the theme set directory structure, and these are defined in the systems configuration file `es_systems.xml` either via the optional `<theme>` tag, or otherwise via the mandatory `<name>` tag. When ES-DE populates a system on startup it will look for a file named `theme.xml` in each such directory.

By placing a theme.xml file directly in the root of the theme set directory, that file will be processed as a default if there is no game-specific theme.xml file available.

In the example below, we have a theme set named `mythemeset-DE` which includes the `snes` and `nes` systems. Assuming you have some games installed for these systems, the files `mythemeset-DE/nes/theme.xml` and `mythemeset-DE/snes/theme.xml` will be processed on startup. If there are no games available for a system, its theme.xml file will be skipped.

The directory structure of our example theme set could look something like the following:

```
...
   themes/
      mythemeset-DE/
         core/
            font.ttf
            bold_font.ttf
            frame.png

         nes/
            theme.xml
            background.jpg
            logo.svg
            logo_video.svg

         snes/
            theme.xml
            background.jpg
            logo.svg
            logo_video.svg

         fonts.xml
         theme.xml
```

The theme set approach makes it easy for users to install different themes and choose between them from the _UI Settings_ menu.

There are two places that ES-DE can load theme sets from:
* `[HOME]/.emulationstation/themes/[THEME_SET]/`
* `[INSTALLATION PATH]/themes/[THEME_SET]/`

An example installation path would be: \
`/usr/share/emulationstation/themes/rbsimple-DE/`

If a theme set with the same name exists in both locations, the one in the home directory will be loaded and the other one will be skipped.

## Simple example

Here is a very simple theme that changes the color of the game description text:

```xml
<theme>
    <formatVersion>7</formatVersion>
    <view name="detailed">
        <text name="description">
            <color>00FF00</color>
        </text>
        <image name="frame" extra="true">
            <pos>0.5 0.5</pos>
            <origin>0.5 0.5</origin>
            <size>0.8 0.8</size>
            <path>./core/frame.png</path>
        </image>
    </view>
</theme>
```

## How it works

All configuration must be contained within a `<theme>` tag pair.

The `<formatVersion>` tag **must** be specified. This is the version of the theming system the theme was designed for.
The current version is 7.

A _view_ can be thought of as a particular "screen" within ES-DE. Views are defined like this:

```xml
<view name="ViewNameHere">
    ... define elements here ...
</view>
```

An *element* is a particular visual element, such as an image or a piece of text.  You can modify an element that already exists for a particular view, as was done for the "description" example:

```xml
<elementTypeHere name="ExistingElementNameHere">
    ... define properties here ...
</elementTypeHere>
```

Or you can create your own elements by adding `extra="true"`, as was done for the "frame" example:

```xml
<elementTypeHere name="YourUniqueElementNameHere" extra="true">
    ... define properties here ...
</elementTypeHere>
```

"Extra" elements will be drawn in the order they are defined (so make sure to define backgrounds first). In what order they get drawn relative to the pre-existing elements depends on the view. Make sure "extra" element names do not clash with existing element names. An easy way to protect against this is to start all your extra element names with a prefix such as "e_".



*Properties* control how a particular *element* looks - for example its position, size, image path etc.  The type of the property determines what kinds of values you can use.  You can read about the types below in the "Reference" section.  Properties are defined like this:

```xml
<propertyNameHere>ValueHere</propertyNameHere>
```


## Advanced features

If you are writing a theme it's recommended to launch ES-DE with the `--debug` flag from a terminal window. If on Unix you can also pass the `--windowed` and `--resolution` flags to avoid having the application window fill the entire screen. On macOS and Windows you only need to pass the `--resolution` flag to accomplish this. By doing so, you can read error messages directly in the terminal window without having to open the log file.  You can also reload the current gamelist view and system view with `Ctrl-R` if the `--debug` flag has been set.

### The \<include\> tag

You can include theme files within theme files, for example:

`~/.emulationstation/themes/mythemeset-DE/fonts.xml`:
```xml
<theme>
    <formatVersion>7</formatVersion>
    <view name="detailed">
        <text name="description">
            <fontPath>./core/font.ttf</fontPath>
            <fontSize>0.035</fontSize>
            <color>00FF00</color>
        </text>
    </view>
</theme>
```

`~/.emulationstation/themes/mythemeset-DE/snes/theme.xml`:
```xml

<theme>
    <formatVersion>7</formatVersion>
    <include>./../fonts.xml</include>
    <view name="detailed">
        <text name="description">
            <color>FF0000</color>
        </text>
    </view>
</theme>
```

The above is equivalent to the following:
```xml

<theme>
    <formatVersion>7</formatVersion>
    <view name="detailed">
        <text name="description">
            <fontPath>./core/font.ttf</fontPath>
            <fontSize>0.035</fontSize>
            <color>FF0000</color>
        </text>
    </view>
</theme>
```

Note that properties can get merged. In the above example the `<color>` tag from `fonts.xml` got overwritten by the equivalent tag in `snes/theme.xml`. This happens because that tag was effectively declared after the first `<color>` tag. Be aware that the included file also needs the `<formatVersion>` tag.


### Theming multiple views simultaneously

Sometimes you want to apply the same properties to the same elements across multiple views.  The `name` attribute actually works as a list (delimited by any characters of `\t\r\n ,` - that is, whitespace and commas).  So for example, to apply the same logo to the basic and detailed views you could write the following:

```xml
<theme>
    <formatVersion>7</formatVersion>
    <view name="basic, detailed">
        <image name="logo">
            <path>./snes/logo.svg</path>
        </image>
    </view>
    <view name="video">
        <image name="logo">
            <path>./snes/logo_video.svg</path>
        </image>
    </view>
</theme>
```

The above is equivalent to:

```xml
<theme>
    <formatVersion>7</formatVersion>
    <view name="basic">
        <image name="logo">
            <path>./snes/logo.svg</path>
        </image>
    </view>
    <view name="detailed">
        <image name="logo">
            <path>./snes/logo.svg</path>
        </image>
    </view>
    <view name="video">
        <image name="logo">
            <path>./snes/logo_video.svg</path>
        </image>
    </view>
</theme>
```


### Theming multiple elements simultaneously

You can theme multiple elements *of the same type* simultaneously.  The `name` attribute actually works as a list (delimited by any characters of `\t\r\n ,` - that is, whitespace and commas). This is useful if you want to, say, apply the same color to all the metadata labels:

```xml
<theme>
    <formatVersion>7</formatVersion>
    <view name="detailed">
        <!-- Weird spaces/newline on purpose -->
        <text name="md_lbl_rating, md_lbl_releasedate, md_lbl_developer, md_lbl_publisher,
        md_lbl_genre,    md_lbl_players,        md_lbl_lastplayed, md_lbl_playcount">
            <color>48474D</color>
        </text>
    </view>
</theme>
```

Which is equivalent to:
```xml
<theme>
    <formatVersion>7</formatVersion>
    <view name="detailed">
        <text name="md_lbl_rating">
            <color>48474D</color>
        </text>
        <text name="md_lbl_releasedate">
            <color>48474D</color>
        </text>
        <text name="md_lbl_developer">
            <color>48474D</color>
        </text>
        <text name="md_lbl_publisher">
            <color>48474D</color>
        </text>
        <text name="md_lbl_genre">
            <color>48474D</color>
        </text>
        <text name="md_lbl_players">
            <color>48474D</color>
        </text>
        <text name="md_lbl_lastplayed">
            <color>48474D</color>
        </text>
        <text name="md_lbl_playcount">
            <color>48474D</color>
        </text>
    </view>
</theme>
```

Just remember, _this only works if the elements have the same type._


### Navigation sounds

Navigation sounds are configured globally per theme set, so it needs to be defined as a feature and with the view set to the special "all" category.
It's recommended to put these elements in a separate file and include it from the main theme file (e.g. `<include>./navigationsounds.xml</include>`).
There are seven different navigation sounds that can be configured. The names as well as the element structure should be self-explanatory based
on the example below.
Starting ES-DE with the --debug flag will provide feedback on whether any navigation sound elements were read from the theme set. If no navigation sounds are provided by the theme, ES-DE will use the bundled navigation sounds as a fallback. This is done per sound file, so the theme could provide for example one or two custom sounds while using the bundled ES-DE sounds for the rest.

Example debug output:
```
Jul 12 11:28:58 Debug:  NavigationSounds::loadThemeNavigationSounds(): Theme set includes navigation sound support, loading custom sounds
Jul 12 11:28:58 Debug:  Sound::getFromTheme(): Looking for tag <sound name="systembrowse">
Jul 12 11:28:58 Debug:  Sound::getFromTheme(): Tag found, ready to load theme sound file
Jul 12 11:28:58 Debug:  Sound::getFromTheme(): Looking for tag <sound name="quicksysselect">
Jul 12 11:28:58 Debug:  Sound::getFromTheme(): Tag not found, using fallback sound file
```

Example `navigationsounds.xml`, to be included from the main theme file:

```xml
<theme>
    <formatVersion>7</formatVersion>
    <feature supported="navigationsounds">
        <view name="all">
            <sound name="systembrowse">
                  <path>./core/sounds/systembrowse.wav</path>
            </sound>
            <sound name="quicksysselect">
                <path>./core/sounds/quicksysselect.wav</path>
            </sound>
            <sound name="select">
                <path>./core/sounds/select.wav</path>
            </sound>
            <sound name="back">
                <path>./core/sounds/back.wav</path>
            </sound>
            <sound name="scroll">
                <path>./core/sounds/scroll.wav</path>
            </sound>
            <sound name="favorite">
                <path>./core/sounds/favorite.wav</path>
            </sound>
            <sound name="launch">
                <path>./core/sounds/launch.wav</path>
            </sound>
        </view>
    </feature>
</theme>
```

### Element rendering order using zIndex

You can change the order in which elements are rendered by setting their `zIndex` values. All elements have a default value so you only need to define it for the ones you wish to explicitly change. Elements will be rendered in order from smallest to largest values.

Below are the default zIndex values per element type:

#### system
* Extra Elements `extra="true"` - 10
* `carousel name="systemcarousel"` - 40
* `text name="systemInfo"` - 50

#### basic, detailed, video, grid
* `image name="background"` - 0
* Extra Elements `extra="true"` - 10
* `textlist name="gamelist"` - 20
* `imagegrid name="gamegrid"` - 20
* Media
    * `image name="md_image"` - 30
    * `video name="md_video"` - 30
    * `image name="md_marquee"` - 35
* Metadata - 40
    * Labels
        * `text name="md_lbl_rating"`
        * `text name="md_lbl_releasedate"`
        * `text name="md_lbl_developer"`
        * `text name="md_lbl_publisher"`
        * `text name="md_lbl_genre"`
        * `text name="md_lbl_players"`
        * `text name="md_lbl_lastplayed"`
        * `text name="md_lbl_playcount"`
    * Values
        * `rating name="md_rating"`
        * `datetime name="md_releasedate"`
        * `text name="md_developer"`
        * `text name="md_publisher"`
        * `text name="md_genre"`
        * `text name="md_players"`
        * `datetime name="md_lastplayed"`
        * `text name="md_playcount"`
        * `text name="md_description"`
        * `text name="md_name"`
* System Logo/Text - 50
    * `text name="logoText"`
    * `image name="logo"`
* Gamelist information - 50
    * `text name="gamelistInfo"`
* Badges - 50
    * `badges name="md_badges"`

### Theme variables

Theme variables can be used to simplify theme construction.  There are 2 types of variables available.
* System variables
* Theme defined variables

#### System variables

System variables are system specific and are derived from the values in es_systems.xml.
* `system.name`
* `system.fullName`
* `system.theme`

#### Theme defined variables
Variables can also be defined in the theme.
```
<variables>
    <themeColor>8b0000</themeColor>
</variables>
```

#### Usage in themes
Variables can be used to specify the value of a theme property:
```
<color>${themeColor}</color>
```

or to specify only a portion of the value of a theme property:

```
<color>${themeColor}c0</color>
<path>./art/logo/${system.theme}.svg</path>
````

### Types of properties

* NORMALIZED_PAIR - two decimals, in the range [0..1], delimited by a space.  For example, `0.25 0.5`.  Most commonly used for position (x and y coordinates) and size (width and height).
* NORMALIZED_RECT - four decimals, in the range [0..1], delimited by a space. For example, `0.25 0.5 0.10 0.30`.  Most commonly used for padding to store top, left, bottom and right coordinates.
* PATH - a path.  If the first character is a `~`, it will be expanded into the environment variable for the home path (`$HOME` for Linux or `%HOMEPATH%` for Windows) unless overridden using the --home command line option.  If the first character is a `.`, it will be expanded to the theme file's directory, allowing you to specify resources relative to the theme file, like so: `./../general_art/myfont.ttf`.
* BOOLEAN - `true`/`1` or `false`/`0`.
* COLOR - a hexidecimal RGB or RGBA color (6 or 8 digits).  If 6 digits, will assume the alpha channel is `FF` (not transparent).
* FLOAT - a decimal.
* STRING - a string of text.


### Types of elements and their properties

Common to almost all elements is a `pos` and `size` property of the NORMALIZED_PAIR type.  They are normalized in terms of their "parent" object's size; 99% of the time, this is just the size of the screen.  In this case, `<pos>0 0</pos>` would correspond to the top left corner, and `<pos>1 1</pos>` the bottom right corner (a positive Y value points further down).  `pos` almost always refers to the top left corner of your element.  You *can* use numbers outside of the [0..1] range if you want to place an element partially or completely off-screen.

The order you define properties in does not matter.
Remember, you do *not* need to specify every property!
*Note that a view may choose to only make only certain properties on a particular element themeable!*

#### image

Can be created as an extra.

* `pos` - type: NORMALIZED_PAIR.
* `size` - type: NORMALIZED_PAIR.
    - If only one axis is specified (and the other is zero), the other will be automatically calculated in accordance with the image's aspect ratio.
* `maxSize` - type: NORMALIZED_PAIR.
    - The image will be resized as large as possible so that it fits within this size and maintains its aspect ratio.  Use this instead of `size` when you don't know what kind of image you're using so it doesn't get grossly oversized on one axis (e.g. with a game's image metadata).
* `origin` - type: NORMALIZED_PAIR.
    - Where on the image `pos` refers to.  For example, an origin of `0.5 0.5` and a `pos` of `0.5 0.5` would place the image exactly in the middle of the screen.  If the "POSITION" and "SIZE" attributes are themeable, "ORIGIN" is implied.
* `rotation` - type: FLOAT.
    - angle in degrees that the image should be rotated.  Positive values will rotate clockwise, negative values will rotate counterclockwise.
* `rotationOrigin` - type: NORMALIZED_PAIR.
    - Point around which the image will be rotated. Default is `0.5 0.5`.
* `path` - type: PATH.
    - Path to the image file.  Most common extensions are supported (including .jpg, .png, and unanimated .gif).
* `default` - type: PATH.
    - Path to default image file.  Default image will be displayed when selected game does not have an image.
* `tile` - type: BOOLEAN.
    - If true, the image will be tiled instead of stretched to fit its size.  Useful for backgrounds.
* `color` - type: COLOR.
    - Multiply each pixel's color by this color. For example, an all-white image with `<color>FF0000</color>` would become completely red.  You can also control the transparency of an image with `<color>FFFFFFAA</color>` - keeping all the pixels their normal color and only affecting the alpha channel.
* `visible` - type: BOOLEAN.
    - If true, component will be rendered, otherwise rendering will be skipped.  Can be used to hide elements from a particular view.
* `zIndex` - type: FLOAT.
    - z-index value for component.  Components will be rendered in order of z-index value from low to high.

#### imagegrid

* `imageSource` - type: STRING.
    - Selects the image to display. `thumbnail` by default, can also be set to `image`, `miximage`, `screenshot`, `cover`, `marquee` or `3dbox`. If selecting `image`, the media type `miximage` will be tried first, with fallback to `screenshot` and then `cover`.
* `scrollDirection` - type: STRING.
    - `vertical` by default, can also be set to `horizontal`. Not that in `horizontal` mod, the tiles are ordered from top to bottom, then from left to right.
* `centerSelection` - type: BOOLEAN.
    - `false` by default, when `true` the selected tile will be locked to the center of the grid.
* `scrollLoop` - type: BOOLEAN.
    - `false` by default, when `true` the grid will seamlessly loop around when scrolling reaches the end of the list.  Only works when `centerSelection` is `true`.
* `animate` - type : BOOLEAN.
    - `true` by default, when  `false` the grid scrolling will not be animated.

#### badges

It's strongly recommended to use the same image dimensions for all badges as varying aspect ratios will lead to alignment issues.

    - Point around which the image will be rotated. Default is `0.5 0.5`.
* `direction` - type: STRING.
    - Valid values are "row" or "column". Controls the primary layout direction (line axis) for the badges. Lines will fill up in the specified direction. Default is `row`.
* `lines` - type: FLOAT.
    - The number of lines available. Default is `2`.
* `itemsPerLine` - type: FLOAT.
    - Number of badges that fit on a line. When more badges are available a new line will be started. Default is `4`.
* `itemMargin` - type: NORMALIZED_PAIR.
    - The margins between badges. Possible combinations:
    - `x y` - horizontal and vertical margins. Minimum value per axis is `0`, maximum value is `0.2`. Default is `0.01 0.01`. If one of the axis is set to `-1` the margin of the other axis (in pixels) will be used, which makes it possible to get identical spacing between all items regardless of screen aspect ratio.
* `slots` - type: STRING.
    - The badge types that should be displayed. Should be specified as a list of strings delimited by any characters of `\t\r\n ,` - that is, whitespace and commas. The order will be followed when placing badges on the screen. Available badges are:
    - `favorite`: Will be shown when the game is marked as favorite.
    - `completed`: Will be shown when the game is marked as completed.
    - `kidgame`: Will be shown when the game is marked as a kids game.
    - `broken`: Will be shown when the game is marked as broken.
    - `controller`: Will be shown and overlaid by the corresponding controller icon if a controller type has been selected for the game using the metadata editor.
    - `altemulator`: Will be shown when an alternative emulator is setup for the game.
* `controllerPos` - type: NORMALIZED_PAIR.
    - The position of the controller icon relative to the parent `controller` badge. Minimum value per axis is `-1.0`, maximum value is `2.0`. Default is `0.5 0.5` which centers the controller icon on the badge.
* `controllerSize` - type: FLOAT.
    - The size of the controller icon relative to the parent `controller` badge. Minimum value is `0.1`, maximum value is `2.0`. Setting the value to `1.0` sizes the controller icon to the same width as the parent badge. The image aspect ratio is always maintained.
* `customBadgeIcon` - type: PATH.
    - A badge icon override. Specify the badge type in the attribute `badge`. The available badges are the ones listed above.
* `customControllerIcon` - type: PATH.
    - A controller icon override. Specify the controller type in the attribute `controller`. These are the available types:
    - `gamepad_generic`, `gamepad_xbox`, `gamepad_playstation`, `gamepad_nintendo_nes`, `gamepad_nintendo_snes`, `gamepad_nintendo_64`, `joystick_generic`, `joystick_arcade_2_buttons`, `joystick_arcade_3_buttons`, `joystick_arcade_4_buttons`, `joystick_arcade_6_buttons`, `trackball_generic`, `lightgun_generic`, `lightgun_nintendo`, `keyboard_generic`, `mouse_generic`, `mouse_amiga`, `keyboard_mouse_generic`, `steering_wheel_generic`, `wii_remote_nintendo`, `wii_remote_nunchuck_nintendo`, `joycon_left_or_right_nintendo`, `joycon_pair_nintendo`, `unknown`.
* `visible` - type: BOOLEAN.
    - If true, component will be rendered, otherwise rendering will be skipped.  Can be used to hide elements from a particular view.
* `zIndex` - type: FLOAT.
    - z-index value for component.  Components will be rendered in order of z-index value from low to high. Default is `50`.

#### carousel

* `type` - type: STRING.
    - Sets the scoll direction of the carousel.
    - Accepted values are "horizontal", "vertical", "horizontal_wheel" or "vertical_wheel".
    - Default is "horizontal".
* `size` - type: NORMALIZED_PAIR. Default is "1 0.2325"
* `pos` - type: NORMALIZED_PAIR.  Default is "0 0.38375".
* `origin` - type: NORMALIZED_PAIR.
    - Where on the carousel `pos` refers to.  For example, an origin of `0.5 0.5` and a `pos` of `0.5 0.5` would place the carousel exactly in the middle of the screen.  If the "POSITION" and "SIZE" attributes are themeable, "ORIGIN" is implied.
* `color` - type: COLOR.
    - Controls the color of the carousel background.
    - Default is FFFFFFD8
* `logoSize` - type: NORMALIZED_PAIR.  Default is "0.25 0.155"
* `logoScale` - type: FLOAT.
    - Selected logo is increased in size by this scale
    - Default is 1.2
* `logoRotation` - type: FLOAT.
    - Angle in degrees that the logos should be rotated.  Value should be positive.
    - Default is 7.5
    - This property only applies when `type` is "horizontal_wheel" or "vertical_wheel".
* `logoRotationOrigin` - type: NORMALIZED_PAIR.
    - Point around which the logos will be rotated. Default is `-5 0.5`.
    - This property only applies when `type` is "horizontal_wheel" or "vertical_wheel".
* `logoAlignment` - type: STRING.
    - Sets the alignment of the logos relative to the carousel.
    - Accepted values are "top", "bottom" or "center" when `type` is "horizontal" or "horizontal_wheel".
    - Accepted values are "left", "right" or "center" when `type` is "vertical" or "vertical_wheel".
    - Default is "center"
* `maxLogoCount` - type: FLOAT.
    - Sets the number of logos to display in the carousel.
    - Default is 3
* `zIndex` - type: FLOAT.
    - z-index value for component.  Components will be rendered in order of z-index value from low to high.
* `legacyZIndexMode` - type: BOOLEAN
    - If true, the carousel will ignore zIndex and always render on top of other components.

The help system is a special element that displays a context-sensitive list of actions the user can take at any time.  You should try and keep the position constant throughout every screen.  Keep in mind the "default" settings (including position) are used whenever the user opens a menu.
