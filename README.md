EmulationStation Desktop Edition
================================

EmulationStation Desktop Edition is a cross-platform graphical front-end for emulators with controller and keyboard navigation.

This is a fork intended for use primarily on desktop computers where EmulationStation is not the primary interface for the computer.

As such, this fork will not provide full control over emulator settings or emulator button mappings or provide system utility functions and similar. Instead it's assumed that the emulators and the overall environment has been properly configured upfront.

The software comes preconfigured for use with [RetroArch](https://www.retroarch.com), although this can certainly be changed as all emulator settings are fully configurable, even on a per-game basis.

This fork was initially based on RetroPie EmulationStation v2.10.0rp-dev (master).
