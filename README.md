EmulationStation Desktop Edition
================================

EmulationStation Desktop Edition is a cross-platform graphical front-end for emulators with controller and keyboard navigation.

Maybe you're familiar with EmulationStation: yes there are multiple forks available for this software! However this version is intended for use primarily on desktop computers where it's not the primary interface for the computer. As such, the aim is not to provide full control over emulator settings or emulator button mappings, or include system administration functions and similar. Instead it's assumed that the emulators and the overall environment has been properly configured upfront.

The goal is to make the software as easy as possible to install and use, and to suppport the major desktop operating systems: Unix/Linux, macOS and Windows.

The following operating systems have been tested and confirmed as working with ES-DE v1.0.0:

* Kubuntu 20.04
* macOS 10.11.6 (El Capitan)
* Windows 10 (x86)
* Windows 8.1 (x86)

The application probably also works fine on devices such as the Raspberry Pi, but this is beyond the scope of this software fork.

The software comes preconfigured for use primarily with [RetroArch](https://www.retroarch.com), although this can be changed as all emulator settings are fully configurable, even on a per-game basis.

A comprehensive theme set, `rbsimple-DE` (which is based on Recalbox Multi from the Recalbox community) is bundled with the application.

Check out the [User Guide](USERGUIDE.md) for how to quickly get the application up and running! \
(It will also show how to use some of its more advanced features.)
