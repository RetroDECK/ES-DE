# Modern-DE Theme for Emulationstation Desktop Edition

The modern theme is a new theme for ES-DE that supports most latest features such as badges and controllers. The theme
is meant to offer a modern look for ES-DE. The theme is designed with theme variants in mind (v1.3).

We support 8 variants:

- 4:3 dark
- 4:3 light
- 16:9 dark
- 16:9 light
- 16:10 dark
- 16:10 light
- 21:9 dark
- 21:9 light

The variant that is to be used can be selected by changing line 14 of `theme.xml`. This will be made accessible through
the user interface in future updates, specifically v1.3:

```{xml}
<include>./variants/dark21_9/default.xml</include>
```

# Based on
