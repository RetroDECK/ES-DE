# ES-DE Frontend

ES-DE (EmulationStation Desktop Edition) is a frontend for browsing and launching games from your multi-platform collection.

It's officially supported on Linux, macOS, Windows and Android but can also be used on BSD Unix and the Raspberry Pi if you build it yourself from source code.

The goal of this project is to make a high quality frontend that is easy to use, requires minimal setup and configuration, looks nice, and is available across a wide range of operating systems.

It comes preconfigured for use with a large selection of emulators, game engines, game managers and gaming services. It can also run locally installed games and applications. It's fully customizable, so you can easily expand it with support for additional systems and applications.

You can find the complete list of supported game systems in the [User guide](USERGUIDE.md#supported-game-systems).

There are many high-quality themes that can be installed using the built-in theme downloader. You can also find the web version of the themes list here: \
