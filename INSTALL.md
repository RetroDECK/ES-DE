Building
========

EmulationStation-DE uses some C++11 code, which means you'll need to use a compiler that supports that. \
GCC is recommended although other compilers should hopefully work fine as well.

The code has a few dependencies. For building, you'll need CMake and development packages for SDL2, FreeImage, FreeType, libVLC, cURL and RapidJSON.

**On Debian/Ubuntu:**
All of the required packages can be easily installed with `apt-get`:
```bash
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libfreeimage-dev libfreetype6-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev rapidjson-dev \
  libasound2-dev libgl1-mesa-dev build-essential cmake fonts-droid-fallback libvlc-dev \
  libvlccore-dev vlc-bin
```
**On Fedora:**
For this operating system, use `dnf` (with rpmfusion activated) :
```bash
sudo dnf install SDL2-devel freeimage-devel freetype-devel curl-devel \
  alsa-lib-devel mesa-libGL-devel cmake \
  vlc-devel rapidjson-devel
```

To checkout the source, run the following:

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/leonstyhre/emulationstation-de
```

Then generate and build the Makefile using CMake:

```bash
cd emulationstation-de
cmake -DOpenGL_GL_PREFERENCE=GLVND .
make
```

NOTE: to generate a `Debug` build on Unix/Linux, run this:
```bash
cmake -DOpenGL_GL_PREFERENCE=GLVND -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .
make
```
Keep in mind though that a debug version will be much slower due to all compiler optimizations being disabled.

**On Windows:**

[CMake](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html)

[SDL2](http://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL2-devel-2.0.8-VC.zip)

[FreeImage](http://downloads.sourceforge.net/freeimage/FreeImage3154Win32.zip)

[FreeType2](http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/freetype/freetype-2.4.9.tar.bz2) (you'll need to compile)

[cURL](http://curl.haxx.se/download.html) (you'll need to compile or get the pre-compiled DLL version)

[RapisJSON](https://github.com/tencent/rapidjson) (you need to add `include/rapidsjon` to your include path)

Remember to copy the necessary .DLL files into the same folder as the executable: probably FreeImage.dll, freetype6.dll, SDL2.dll, libcurl.dll, and zlib1.dll. Exact list depends on if you built your libraries in "static" mode or not.


Configuring
===========

**~/.emulationstation/es_systems.cfg:**
When first run, an example systems configuration file will be created at `~/.emulationstation/es_systems.cfg`.  `~` is `$HOME` on Linux, and `%HOMEPATH%` on Windows.  This example has some comments explaining how to write the configuration file. See the "Writing an es_systems.cfg" section for more information.

**Keep in mind you'll have to set up your emulator separately from EmulationStation!**

**~/.emulationstation/es_input.cfg:**
When you first start EmulationStation, you will be prompted to configure an input device. The process is thus:

1. Hold a button on the device you want to configure.  This includes the keyboard.

2. Press the buttons as they appear in the list.  Some inputs can be skipped by holding any button down for a few seconds (e.g. page up/page down).

3. You can review your mappings by pressing up and down, making any changes by pressing A.

4. Choose "SAVE" to save this device and close the input configuration screen.

The new configuration will be added to the `~/.emulationstation/es_input.cfg` file.

**Both new and old devices can be (re)configured at any time by pressing the Start button and choosing "CONFIGURE INPUT".**  From here, you may unplug the device you used to open the menu and plug in a new one, if necessary.  New devices will be appended to the existing input configuration file, so your old devices will retain their configuration.

**If your controller stops working, you can delete the `~/.emulationstation/es_input.cfg` file to make the input configuration screen re-appear on the next run.**


You can use `--help` or `-h` to view a list of command-line options. Briefly outlined here:
```
--resolution [width] [height]   Try to force a particular resolution
--gamelist-only                 Skip automatic game ROM search, only read from gamelist.xml
--ignore-gamelist               Ignore the gamelist files (useful for troubleshooting)
--draw-framerate                Display the framerate
--no-exit                       Don't show the exit option in the menu
--no-splash                     Don't show the splash screen
--debug                         Print debug information
--windowed                      Windowed mode, should be combined with --resolution
--fullscreen-normal             Normal fullscreen mode
--fullscreen-borderless         Borderless fullscreen mode (always on top)
--vsync [1/on or 0/off]         Turn vsync on or off (default is on)
--max-vram [size]               Max VRAM to use in Mb before swapping
                                Set to at least 20 to avoid unpredictable behavior
--force-kid                     Force the UI mode to Kid
--force-kiosk                   Force the UI mode to Kiosk
--force-disable-filters         Force the UI to ignore applied filters in gamelist
--home [path]                   Directory to use as home path
--version, -v                   Displays version information
--help, -h                      Summon a sentient, angry tuba
```

As long as ES hasn't frozen, you can always press F4 to close the application.


Writing an es_systems.cfg
=========================

Complete configuration instructions at [emulationstation.org](http://emulationstation.org/gettingstarted.html#config).

The `es_systems.cfg` file contains the system configuration data for EmulationStation, written in XML. \
This tells EmulationStation what systems you have, what platform they correspond to (for scraping), and where the games are located.

ES will check two places for an es_systems.cfg file, in the following order, stopping after it finds one that works:
* `~/.emulationstation/es_systems.cfg`
* `/etc/emulationstation/es_systems.cfg`

The order EmulationStation displays systems reflects the order you define them in.

**NOTE:** A system *must* have at least one game present in its "path" directory, or ES will ignore it! If no valid systems are found, ES will report an error and quit!

Here's an example es_systems.cfg:

```xml
<!-- This is the EmulationStation Systems configuration file.
All systems must be contained within the <systemList> tag.-->

<systemList>
	<!-- Here's an example system to get you started. -->
	<system>
		<!-- A short name, used internally. -->
		<name>snes</name>

		<!-- A "pretty" name, displayed in the menus and such. This one is optional. -->
		<fullname>Super Nintendo Entertainment System</fullname>

		<!-- The path to start searching for ROMs in. '~' will be expanded to $HOME or %HOMEPATH%, depending on platform.
		All subdirectories (and non-recursive links) will be included. -->
		<path>~/roms/snes</path>

		<!-- A list of extensions to search for, delimited by any of the whitespace characters (", \r\n\t").
		You MUST include the period at the start of the extension! It's also case sensitive. -->
		<extension>.smc .sfc .SMC .SFC</extension>

		<!-- The shell command executed when a game is selected. A few special tags are replaced if found in a command, like %ROM% (see below). -->
		<command>snesemulator %ROM%</command>
		<!-- This example would run the bash command "snesemulator /home/user/roms/snes/Super\ Mario\ World.sfc". -->

		<!-- The platform(s) to use when scraping. You can see the full list of accepted platforms in src/PlatformIds.cpp.
		It's case sensitive, but everything is lowercase. This tag is optional.
		You can use multiple platforms too, delimited with any of the whitespace characters (", \r\n\t"), eg: "genesis, megadrive" -->
		<platform>snes</platform>

		<!-- The theme to load from the current theme set. See THEMES.md for more information.
		This tag is optional; if not set, it will use the value of <name>. -->
		<theme>snes</theme>
	</system>
</systemList>
```

The following "tags" are replaced by ES in launch commands:

`%ROM%`		- Replaced with absolute path to the selected ROM, with most Bash special characters escaped with a backslash.

`%BASENAME%`	- Replaced with the "base" name of the path to the selected ROM. For example, a path of "/foo/bar.rom", this tag would be "bar". This tag is useful for setting up AdvanceMAME.

`%ROM_RAW%`	- Replaced with the unescaped, absolute path to the selected ROM.  If your emulator is picky about paths, you might want to use this instead of %ROM%, but enclosed in quotes.

See [SYSTEMS.md](SYSTEMS.md) for some live examples in EmulationStation.

gamelist.xml
============

The gamelist.xml file for a system defines metadata for games, such as a name, description, release date, and rating.

As of the fork to EmulationStation Desktop Edition, game media information no longer needs to be defined in the gamelist.xml files. Instead the application will look for any media matching the ROM filename. The media path where to look for game art is configurable either manually in es_settings.cfg or via the GUI.

If at least one game in a system has an image (mix image, screenshot or box cover), ES will use the detailed view for that system (which displays metadata alongside the game list).

*You can use ES's [scraping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping) tools to avoid creating a gamelist.xml by hand.*  There are two ways to run the scraper:

* **If you want to scrape multiple games:** press start to open the menu and choose the "SCRAPER" option.  Adjust your settings and press "START".
* **If you just want to scrape one game:** find the game on the game list in ES and press select.  Choose "EDIT THIS GAME'S METADATA" and then press the "SCRAPE" button at the bottom of the metadata editor.

You can also edit metadata within ES by using the metadata editor - just find the game you wish to edit on the gamelist, press Select, and choose "EDIT THIS GAME'S METADATA."

The switch `--ignore-gamelist` can be used to ignore the gamelist and force ES to use the non-detailed view.

If you're writing a tool to generate or parse gamelist.xml files, you should check out [GAMELISTS.md](GAMELISTS.md) for more detailed documentation.
